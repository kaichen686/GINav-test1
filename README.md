# GINav-test
This is a repository for sharing test reports of GNIav v2.0 <br>
GINav v2.0 is developed based on C language. Compared with [GINav v1.0](https://github.com/kaichen686/GINav), GINav v2.0 has done a lot of optimization and improvement <br>
*******************************************
The test report is available as a PDF file
*******************************************

The main features of the software are: <br>
* Support GNSS absolute positioning modes, include standard single positioning (SPP) and precise single positioning (PPP) <br>
* Support GNSS relative positioning modes, include post-processed differenced, kinematic and static (PPD, PPK and PPS) <br>
* Support multi-constellation and multi-frequency GNSS data processing <br>
* Support GNSS/INS loosely coupled (LC) modes, include SPP/INS LC, PPD/INS LC, PPK/INS LC and PPP/INS LC <br>
* Support GNSS/INS tightly coupled (TC) modes, include SPP/INS TC, PPD/INS TC, PPK/INS TC and PPP/INS TC <br>
* INS-aided cycle slip detection and robust estimation for GNSS/INS integration <br>
* Convenient visualization <br>
* Support lever-arm, scale factor error and cross-coupling error estimation (new)<br>
* Support ZUPT (new)<br>
* Support more robust INS-aided GNSS quality control strategies (new)<br>
* Support forward/backward filter sommoth (new)<br>
* Support forward/backward RTS sommoth (new)<br>
